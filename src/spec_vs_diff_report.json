  "summary": "Most Valentine UI revamp is implemented: new Screen1/Screen2 components with kawaii styling, evasive NO behavior (hover + touch), gift overlays, and three gift views with the requested animations and static asset references. However, a few requirements are not fully verifiable or appear to deviate from exact-text requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Screen 1 buttons must be labeled exactly “YES OF COURSE” and “NO THANK YOU” (exactly two options).",
      "reason": "The YES button label includes an extra emoji (“YES OF COURSE 💖”), which violates the “exactly” label requirement.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Gift 1 message bubbles must match the provided text exactly (including punctuation).",
      "reason": "One bubble uses a straight apostrophe \"I can't imagine my life without you\" whereas the requirement specifies a curly apostrophe \"I can’t imagine my life without you\". If interpreted strictly as exact punctuation, this is a mismatch.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "All newly required decorative/character/illustration assets must be added as static files under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "reason": "The diff shows components referencing the required asset paths, but does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so implementation cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
